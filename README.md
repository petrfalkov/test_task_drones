# test_task_drones
Test task from Phoundry.

Create a service to upload, save and sort photos.
Tried to realise infinite scroll, then broke search, but scroll working. (Type of pagination)
Used: PHP, MySQL, AJAX

To see how it's working I was using MAMP.
1. Setup MAMP.
In settings:
2. Choose nginx WebServer
3. Port for nginx: 8081
4. Port for MySQL: 3036
5. PHP standart version: 5.6.24

Then Upload all files from dir 'task' in MAMP/htdocs/your_dir
To see how it's working I type loclalhost:8081/your_dir/view in adress bar of Google Chrome Browser. Then you will find out.
